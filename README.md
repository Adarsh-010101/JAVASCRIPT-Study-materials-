   ### LET ( Using 'LET' , while declaring a variable and assigning it with some values that can be updated later .
   
   EXAMPLE ->   
   
   let myclass = 'class'; // myclass decalared using 'let' and assigned = 'class'                               - CONSOLE-OUTPUT -
   console.log(myclass);                                                                                               class


   myclass = 'A';          // Upadated value of var myclass again with 'A' 
   console.log(myclass);                                                                                                 A

   myclass = 'B';          // Upadated value of var myclass again with 'B' 
   console.log(myclass);                                                                                                 B

   myclass = 'C';          // Upadated value of var myclass again with 'C' 
   console.log(myclass);                                                                                                 C

   myclass = 'D';          // Upadated value of var myclass again with 'D' 
   console.log(myclass);                                                                                                 D

   myclass = 'E';          // Upadated value of var myclass again with 'E' 
   console.log(myclass);                                                                                                 E
