## Let & const 
   ### LET ( Using 'LET' , while declaring a variable and assigning it with some values that can be updated later .
   
   EXAMPLE ->   
   
    let myclass = 'class'; 
    console.log(myclass);  // Output - class                                                                                              


    myclass = 'A';         
    console.log(myclass);  // Output -   A                                                                                           

    myclass = 'B';         
    console.log(myclass);  // Output -   B                                                                               

    myclass = 'C';        
    console.log(myclass);  // Output -   C                                                                              

    myclass = 'D';        
    console.log(myclass);   // Output -   D                                                                           

    myclass = 'E';        
    console.log(myclass);   // Output -   E , in this case - Value of variable 'myclass' gets updated every time we declare a new value to it .

   ### CONST ( Using 'CONST' , at the time of variable declaration , the value assigned to the variable remains constant and  can not be changed )
   Example ->
   
    const status = 'Qualified';
    console.log(status);


    status = 'Disqualified';
    console.log(status);    
   
    // Output - ' Qualified ' & will show type error as for the assignment to constant variable (in this case - Value assigned once to the variable 'status'  will    always be the same , as it says the  "const var" will be constant always.)
